# dash-rs

A Rust implementation of MPEG-DASH playback logic.

dash-rs provides the core building blocks needed to drive a DASH adaptive streaming session from native Rust code.

## What's included

- VOD/AOD playback
- Live playback
- Seeking
- ABR (see rules below)
- Playback metrics
- Logging
- WASM + GStreamer examples (see below for how to run)

### ABR rules

| Rule | Algorithm | dash.js equivalent |
|---|---|---|
| `ThroughputRule` | Picks the highest bitrate that fits within measured bandwidth × safety factor | `ThroughputRule.js` |
| `BufferOccupancyRule` | BOLA-inspired: maps buffer level to a Lyapunov utility score | `BolaRule.js` |
| `InsufficientBufferRule` | Forces lowest quality when buffer falls below 2 s | `InsufficientBufferRule.js` |
| `SwitchHistoryRule` | Prevents quality thrashing by enforcing an 8 s up-switch cooldown | `SwitchHistoryRule.js` |
| `DroppedFramesRule` | Steps down quality when the decoder drop-frame ratio exceeds a threshold | `DroppedFramesRule.js` |
| `AbandonRequestsRule` | Abandons an in-flight segment and switches down when effective download speed falls far below the current bitrate | `AbandonRequestRule.js` |

The `AbrController` runs all six rules and takes the most conservative result.

### Spec compliance and missing features

For a full breakdown of DASH spec compliance, behavioural differences relative
to dash.js, and the prioritised list of unimplemented features, see
[/dash-compliance.md](docs/dash-compliance.md).

## Running the examples

### `basic` — no network required

Parses a synthetic multi-bitrate MPD, simulates 5 fetch iterations with
improving network conditions, and prints each quality decision. No network
access or external dependencies are required.

```bash
cargo run --example basic
```

### `http_fetch` — real HTTP, no media output

Fetches the a DASH stream over HTTP and prints per-segment ABR decisions to stdout. Requires internet access. No media sink is involved, segments are simply fetched and discarded. This example exercises `DashSession` and the full ABR pipeline end-to-end without any rendering dependency.

```bash
# Uses the BBC R&D Big Buck Bunny manifest by default
cargo run --example http_fetch

# Override the manifest URL
cargo run --example http_fetch -- https://your-stream/manifest.mpd
```

Expected output (excerpt):

```
Loaded manifest: https://dash.akamaized.net/akamai/bbb_30fps/bbb_30fps.mpd
Video representations (sorted by bandwidth):
  [0]   256kbps  320x180

  ...

=== Fetching 8 segments ===
  seg   vid-idx  vid-reason    aud-idx  aud-reason    video fetch
  1     2        Throughput    0        Throughput     312 ms  (3842 kbps)
  2     3        Throughput    0        Throughput      89 ms  (5201 kbps)
  ...
```

### `wasm_player` — browser playback via WebAssembly

Runs the full MPEG-DASH session in the browser.  The architecture is a **JS-bridge**: all browser Web API calls (MSE, Fetch, clocks) live in `examples/wasm_player/player.js` as an annotated `bridge` object.  WASM calls
bridge methods via the `JsBridge` extern type in `src/lib.rs`; Rust never
touches browser objects directly.  Reading `player.js` top-to-bottom shows the
complete set of Web APIs involved in MPEG-DASH playback.

An on-screen **player log** panel shows all output colour-coded by source:
- Bridge calls: coloured by Web API category (MSE = blue, Fetch = green, …)
- `PlayerEvent::Log` messages and example-side Rust diagnostics.

**Prerequisites:** `wasm-pack` (`cargo install wasm-pack`)

```bash
# Build the WASM module (from workspace root)
wasm-pack build examples/wasm_player --target web --out-dir pkg

# Serve the player with any static file server
python3 -m http.server 8080 --directory examples/wasm_player
# then open http://localhost:8080
```

Pass a custom manifest URL via the `?url=` query parameter:

```
http://localhost:8080/?url=https://your-stream/manifest.mpd
```

### `gstreamer_player` — full AV playback (`sink-gstreamer` feature)

Fetches and plays back the BBC R&D Big Buck Bunny stream using GStreamer as the
media sink. Requires GStreamer ≥ 1.14 and a display.

**Prerequisites:**

```bash
# macOS
brew install gstreamer protobuf

# Debian / Ubuntu
apt-get install gstreamer1.0-tools gstreamer1.0-plugins-good \
                gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-libav \
                protobuf-compiler
```

On macOS, if `cargo build` cannot find GStreamer headers, prepend the framework
`bin` directory so its `pkg-config` is found first:

```bash
export PATH="/Library/Frameworks/GStreamer.framework/Versions/1.0/bin:$PATH"
```

**Run:**

```bash
# Default stream (BBC R&D Big Buck Bunny)
cargo run --features sink-gstreamer --example gstreamer_player

# Override the manifest URL
cargo run --features sink-gstreamer --example gstreamer_player -- https://your-stream/manifest.mpd
```

Expected output (excerpt):

```
Loaded manifest: https://dash.akamaized.net/akamai/bbb_30fps/bbb_30fps.mpd
Pipeline playing.

=== Fetching 8 segments (buffer target: 12 s) ===
  seg   vid-idx  vid-reason    aud-idx  aud-reason    buf-est     video fetch
  1     2        Throughput    0        Throughput       0.0 s     312 ms  (3842 kbps)
  2     3        Throughput    0        Throughput       3.8 s      89 ms  (5201 kbps)
  ...

All segments fetched — waiting for pipeline EOS…
Done.

GapController  (owned by DashSession; caller drives via session.tick_gap())
└── tick_gap(position_s, buffered, PlaybackState) → Option<GapSeekTarget>
    └── on gap/stall: caller seeks renderer, then calls session.seek_to()
        └── seek_to() automatically resets the gap controller (on_seek())
```

Data flow per segment:

1. `AbrController::select` picks a `QualityDecision` from `AbrMetrics`.
2. `DashSession` resolves the segment URL from the MPD `SegmentTemplate` for the current period.
3. `SegmentFetcher::fetch` retrieves the bytes.
4. `MediaBuffer::append(mt, data, is_init)` forwards the bytes to the decoder.
5. At period boundaries, `fetch_next_segment` transparently advances to the next `Period` and re-fetches init segments before continuing.
